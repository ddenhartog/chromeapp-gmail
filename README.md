GMail GUI for Chrome
====================

A [Chrome Application](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/about_apps) for running a "webview" (i.e. an iframe) for [GMail](https://mail.google.com).


- **Runs on any Desktop OS**. This single application runs on Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux - anywhere that Chrome (or Chromium) can run.
- **Easy-to-use BTsync GUI**. This loads the native browser GUI for BTsync; it is not a separate application. Think of this as a frame for BTsync GUI.
- **Easy to access**. You can put a chrome application in your start menu or task bar (windows), on your dock (linux/mac osx), or on your desktop. This makes accessing the BTsync GUI very similar to using a native application, without the extra overhead.
